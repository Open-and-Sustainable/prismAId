The paper discusses the development of an adaptation model for flooding in the Colorado River Basin, utilizing historical and future hazard data from 1977 to 2100. It employs statistical methods, including copulas and zero-inflated negative binomial regression, to analyze the relationship between natural hazards, exposure, and damage. The findings emphasize the importance of updating hazard expectations for effective adaptation strategies, highlighting that communities that quickly adjust their beliefs about future risks can significantly reduce potential damages from climate change.
