# Open Science AI Tools for Systematic, Protocol-Based Literature Reviews.

## Purpose
prismAId uses generative AI models to extract data from scientific literature. It offers simple-to-use, efficient, and replicable methods for analyzing literature when conducting systematic reviews. No coding skills are required to use prismAId.

## Specifications
- **Review protocol**: Designed to support any literature review protocol with a preference for [Prisma 2020](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020), which inspired our project name.
- **Distribution**: As Go [package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Open-and-Sustainable/prismAId) or 'no-coding' binaries compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems on AMD64 and ARM64 platforms.
- **Supported LLMs**: 
    1. **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o Mini.
    2. **GoogleAI**: Gemini 1.0 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash.
    3. **Cohere**: Command, Command Light, Command R, and Command R+.
    4. **Anthropic**: Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Output format**: Outputs data in CSV or JSON formats.
- **Performance**: Designed to process extensive datasets efficiently with minimal user setup and **no coding** required.
- **Programming Language**: Developed in Go.
