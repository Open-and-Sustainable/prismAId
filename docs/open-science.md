# Contribution to Open Science
prismAId supports Open Science in many aspects:

## Transparency and Reproducibility
   - prismAId ensures transparency in the analysis process, making it easier for other researchers to understand, replicate, and validate the findings.
   - prismAId removes the subjectivity of individual interpretations, making systematic literature reviews 100% reproducible.
   - As a software tool, prismAId helps maintain detailed logs and records of the analysis process, enhancing reproducibility.

## Accessibility and Collaboration
   - prismAId facilitates collaboration among researchers by providing an open tool that makes it possible to share data, analysis methods, and results.
   - prismAId is open source and openly licensed. Making analysis tools openly available promotes wider participation and contribution from the scientific community.
   - prismAId releases and their source code are archived on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.11210796), ensuring long-term accessibility and referencability. This helps address legacy issues for analyses conducted using prismAId, making the tool and its results open, replicable, and understandable over the long run.

## Efficiency and Scalability
   - prismAId can handle large volumes of data efficiently, making the analysis phase quicker and more scalable compared to traditional methods.
   - This efficiency supports open science by allowing more comprehensive and timely reviews, reducing the time society needs to properly 'digest' scientific innovations.

## Quality and Accuracy
   - By explicitly defining each piece of reviewed information through prompt configurations, prismAId enhances the quality and accuracy of data extraction and analysis, leading to more reliable systematic reviews.
   - Publishing prismAId project configuration files ensures that approaches, biases, and methods are visible and verifiable by the broader research community. By doing so, they are also reusable and extendable.

## Ethical Considerations and Bias Reduction
   - Using prismAId means explicitly addressing biases and incorporating ethical considerations in its design and implementation to minimize biases in data analysis.
   - prismAId enables open science approaches, ensuring full transparency on ethical standards, with community oversight and input helping to identify and mitigate potential biases.

## Scientific Innovation
   - prismAId promotes scientific innovation by fully formalizing the analysis process, creating standardized procedures that ensure consistency and accuracy in systematic reviews.
   - This formalization makes methods and procedures reusable and extendable, allowing researchers to build upon previous analyses and adapt methods to new contexts.
   - By facilitating incremental discoveries, prismAId supports the cumulative advancement of science, where each study contributes to a larger body of knowledge.
   - prismAId's commitment to open science principles ensures that all tools, methods, and data are openly accessible, fostering collaboration and rapid dissemination of innovations.
