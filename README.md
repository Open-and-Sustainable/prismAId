# Open Science AI Tools for Systematic, Protocol-Based Literature Reviews

## Introduction
### Purpose
prismAId leverages generative AI to extract data from scientific literature. prismAId assists researchers by offering a simple-to-use, efficient, and replicable method for analyzing literature when conducting systematic reviews. No coding skills are required to use prismAId.

### Specifications
- **Review protocol**: Designed to support any literature review protocol, but our preference is for [Prisma 2020](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020) (hence the project name).
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems, on AMD64 and ARM64 platforms.
- **Supported LLMs**: 
    1. **OpenAI**: GPT 3.5 Turbo, GPT 4 Turbo, GPT4o, and GPT4o Mini.
- **Input format**: Requires TXT files for scientific papers.
- **Project Configuration**: Uses TOML files for easy project setup and parameter configuration.
- **Output format**: Outputs data in CSV and JSON formats.
- **Performance**: Designed to process extensive datasets efficiently with minimal user setup and **no coding**.
- **Programming Language**: Developed in Go.
