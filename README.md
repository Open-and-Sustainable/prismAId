# Open Science AI Tools for Systematic, Protocol-Based Literature Reviews

## Introduction
### Purpose
prismAId uses generative AI models to extract data from scientific literature. It offers simple-to-use, efficient, and replicable methods for analyzing literature when conducting systematic reviews. No coding skills are required to use prismAId.

### Specifications
- **Review protocol**: Designed to support any literature review protocol with a preference for [Prisma 2020](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020), which inspired our project name.
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems on AMD64 and ARM64 platforms.
- **Supported LLMs**: 
    1. **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o Mini.
- **Output format**: Outputs data in CSV and JSON formats.
- **Performance**: Designed to process extensive datasets efficiently with minimal user setup and **no coding** required.
- **Programming Language**: Developed in Go.
