## 1. Introduction
### Scope
- PrismAId is a software tool designed to leverage the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) or AI Foundation models in understanding text content for conducting systematic reviews of scientific literature.
- It aims to make the systematic review process easy, requiring no coding.
- PrismAId is designed to be much faster than traditional human-based approaches, offering also a high-speed software implementation.
- It ensures full replicability. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on subjective interpretation and classification of scientific concepts, prismAId addresses the primary issue of replicability in systematic reviews.
- Beneficiaries: Any scientist conducting a literature review or meta-analysis for developing projects, proposals, or manuscripts.

## 2. Project Overview
### Description of Underlying Mechanism
- How LLMs work:
  - LLMs (Large Language Models) are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.
  - These models can perform a variety of language tasks such as text completion, summarization, translation, and more.
  
- Data flow and processing steps:
  - Contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs offer subscription-based API access.
  - While foundation models can be used in various ways, PrismAId focuses solely on prompt engineering or prompting.
  - Prompt engineering involves crafting precise prompts to extract specific information from the AI model via the API.
  - PrismAId simplifies the creation of rigorous and replicable prompts to extract information through the AI model API.
  - The data flow of PrismAId is embedded in protocol-based approaches to reviews:
    - Initially, there is a selection of literature to be analyzed through detailed protocol steps.
    - Next, the content of these papers is classified, which is where PrismAId plays a crucial role.
  - PrismAId allows for parsing the selected review and extracting the information the researcher is interested in.

Current foundation models have enough knowledge to understand quite complex scientific concepts  

While model fine tuning and training of as hoc models is possible, it is extremely expensive both because of developing the training set and for actually running the training on dedicated hardware.  

Prompt engineering protocols can be defined and supported to ensure both accuracy and replicability
