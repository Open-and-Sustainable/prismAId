## What problem does prismAId solve?
The most subjective and not replicable part of systematic review is the mapping of knowledge  
It is also subject to fatigue and impossible to be run by the same reviewer  

## How does prismAId work?
Foundation models are very good at understanding text and deriving information out of it  
Current foundation models have enough knowledge to understand quite complex scientific concepts  
While model fine tuning and training of as hoc models is possible, it is extremely expensive both because of developing the training set and for actually running the training on dedicated hardware.  
Prompt engineering protocols can be defined and supported to ensure both accuracy and replicability
